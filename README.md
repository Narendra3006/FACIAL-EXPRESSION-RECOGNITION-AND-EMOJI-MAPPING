# Facial Expression Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks for Emoji Mapping


Facial expression recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling machines to understand and interpret human emotions. By analyzing the subtle changes
in facial features, such as eye movements, mouth shape, and eyebrow position, FER systems can identify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

CNNs, known for their exceptional performance in image classification tasks, have proven highly effective in FER.


## Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial Expression Recognition

CNNs excel at extracting visual features from images, enabling them to learn complex patterns and relationships. In FER, CNNs typically process facial images through a series of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers learn to identify key features related to facial expressions and subsequently classify the input image as representing a particular emotion.

## FER 2013 Dataset

This project utilizes the FER 2013 dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for facial expression recognition research. It consists of 35,887 grayscale images of faces, each labeled with one of seven basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The dataset's diversity and standardized labeling make it ideal for training and evaluating FER models.


## Real-time Emoji Mapping with OpenCV

To demonstrate the practical applications of FER, I project implemented a real-time emoji mapping system using OpenCV. OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library that provides tools for capturing video streams, detecting faces, and extracting facial features.

Here is a simple result:
